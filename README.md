This is a good sample project for getting started with the File System and System.IO.

This project has the goal of renaming files on your PC by finding the word "TEXT" and making it "JACOB"
It then finds "JACOB" and returns the name back to "TEXT"

If no files exist in the directory or if the directory does not exist both the files and the directory are created.
